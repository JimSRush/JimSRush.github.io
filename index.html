        Ricardo loves to live. He travels, he is a hard worker, he is a man to be respected.
        <br>Join him in his daily coffee ritual, see what he sees. Relax.
        <br>There are no high-scores, you can not fail, this is the real world. Controls: spacebar. We highly recommend headphones.
